# Power System Stability Prediction: A Comparative Analysis of Baseline, ANN Feature Extraction, and Hybrid Models
This repository presents a machine learning approach to predict smart grid stability. It explores the performance of baseline classification models, uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for feature extraction, and then combines these extracted features with various classifiers to build hybrid ensemble models. The project is organized into modules, and all analysis and visualizations are done in a Jupyter Notebook.
